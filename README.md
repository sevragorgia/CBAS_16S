# CBAS_16S

## Collection of CBAS V4 16S sequencing from diverse experiments.

This repository provides access to the results of different experiments involving 16S V4 amplicon sequencing on CBAS (aka *Lendenfeldia chondrodes*). At present it provides access to the data generated for Vargas et al. unpublished experiment on the effects of bleaching on microbiome composition and gene expression in CBAS. These data can be found in the folder *Shading*, there the following subfolders can be found:

  - Shading_OTUTables: OTU tables from the shading experiment in Vargas et al. unpublished. These OTU tables are provided with and without taxonomic assignments and an R script to analyze the data can also be found in this folder.

  - vsearch_needed_files: tar.gz file with some files necessary to run vsearch and generate the OTU Tables.
 
  - vsearch_script: script to generate OTUs using vsearch. Note I basically took the the script found [here](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/wiki/VSEARCH-pipeline) and modified it to suit my needs.
